# Scenario:

Imagine you are a Product Manager at a fast-growing AI company building next-generation productivity tools. Your team is working on an AI-powered document intelligence platform that helps professionals extract insights, summarize key information, and automate repetitive tasks.

The company’s Applied Data Science and Research Labs have recently developed a new Large Language Model (LLM) and reasoning engine capable of:

1. Extracting structured data from unstructured documents (e.g., emails, PDFs, contracts, reports).
2. Providing AI-driven summarization and recommendations based on extracted insights.
3. Reasoning over extracted data to automate decision-making tasks (e.g., risk assessment, approvals, or prioritization).

Your job is to define how this AI innovation should be transformed into a real product feature that delivers value to users.

# Your Task:
You are the Product Manager responsible for bringing this AI-driven underwriting assistant to life.

## Part 1: Writing a Feature PRD/User Story
Write a Product Requirements Document (PRD) or a detailed user story for an AI-powered feature that improves underwriting efficiency using LLMs and reasoning models. Your PRD should include:

Define a new AI-powered feature that uses the LLM and reasoning engine to enhance the document intelligence platform. Your PRD should include:

Problem Statement – What user pain point does this feature solve?
User Persona – Who are the primary users, and how do they currently handle this problem?
Proposed Solution – Describe how the AI-powered feature works and integrates into the platform.
Key Functional Requirements – What are the must-have functionalities? (Bullet points or user stories are fine.)
Success Metrics – How will we measure the impact of this feature?
Potential Risks & Mitigations – What challenges might arise, and how would you address them?

## Part 2: Prioritization & Scope Definition
Assume you are considering three potential AI-driven features for the next product release:

AI-Powered Document Summarization – Automatically generates concise summaries of long reports, contracts, or meeting notes.
Automated Data Extraction & Structuring – Converts unstructured data (e.g., invoices, resumes, or customer feedback) into structured formats.
AI-Driven Workflow Automation – Uses reasoning models to automate decisions, such as approving/rejecting requests based on extracted data.
Which feature should be prioritized first? Justify your decision using a prioritization framework of your choice (e.g., RICE, impact vs. effort, Kano Model).
What is the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) scope for your chosen feature?
How would you use data to validate your prioritization decision?

## Part 3: AI Feasibility & Go-To-Market Plan
What technical and business considerations must be addressed before launching this feature?
How would you validate and refine the AI model before a full rollout?
How would you drive user adoption, and what KPIs would you track post-launch?

Submission Format:
Preferred Format: PDF or Google Docs
Concise but structured responses – bullet points, tables, and frameworks are encouraged.
Feel free to include visuals, mockups, or data-driven examples.
